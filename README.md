# Recollect
An urban waste collection service.

We provide efficient solutions for managing solid waste.

Municipalities all around the world are embracing the "smart cities" trend in an effort to manage solid waste more effectively due to growing populations, shifting legislation requirements, new sustainability and recycling targets, and enhanced technology departments. One of the key issues that the cities face, especially in light of the population growth, is the development of the municipal garbage collection service and, generally, the attainment of a more effective management of the waste. So, one of the major components of smart cities is smart trash management.

Recollect is a web application that makes it easy for users to connect to garbage pickup services. In the waste management plants, the waste is properly segregated and treated responsibly. Contribute in helping the environment by signing up for waste collection service!
